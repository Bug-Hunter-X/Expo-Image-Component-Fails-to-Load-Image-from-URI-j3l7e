# Expo Image Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Image` component in Expo applications. The problem involves images failing to load from a given URI, resulting in a blank space where the image should be.

## Problem
The `Image` component in Expo sometimes fails to load images. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including incorrect URIs, network issues, or problems with the image source itself.  The error is not always consistent and might manifest only intermittently.

## Solution
The solution typically involves several steps to diagnose and resolve the issue. This includes verifying the URI, handling network errors gracefully, and potentially using a fallback image in case the primary image fails to load. This example includes improved error handling and a fallback mechanism.

## Setup
Clone the repo and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies. Then, start the app using `expo start`.
